          <p>
            Refuel BCS was founded by <strong>Christopher Braly</strong> and <strong>Christopher Lamb</strong> , two lifelong
            <strong>first responders</strong> with more than <strong> 50 years of combined emergency service experience</strong>.
            With decades spent protecting and serving the Brazos Valley, they built Refuel BCS
            on the same principles that guided their careers... <strong>safety</strong>, <strong>reliability</strong>, and <strong>trust</strong>.
          </p>

          <p class="muted">
            By bringing fuel directly to homes, businesses, and job sites, Refuel BCS delivers
            a safer, more convenient fueling solution that is proudly owned and operated right
            here in the community it serves.

        <h2 class="section-title">Our Story</h2>

        <div class="card black-card story-card">
          <p>
            Our story begins right here in the Brazos Valley. As local first responders,
            we’ve spent our careers serving this community when it matters most—responding
            to emergencies, protecting families, and helping neighbors through their toughest moments.
            That experience shaped who we are and how we approach everything we do.
          </p>

          <p class="muted">
            We started Refuel BCS to build a reputable, locally owned mobile fueling service
            that people can truly count on. Too often, convenience comes at the cost of service
            or accountability. We believe it doesn’t have to. By staying local, hiring responsibly,
            and operating with integrity, our goal is to build long-term relationships with
            individuals, families, and businesses throughout the Brazos Valley.
          </p>

          <p class="muted">
            At its core, Refuel BCS is about safety and convenience. Whether you’re fueling a
            personal vehicle, equipment, generators, or a fleet, traveling to a gas station
            isn’t always practical—or safe. By bringing fuel directly to you, we help reduce
            unnecessary trips, time away from work or family, and exposure to late-night or
            roadside fueling risks.
          </p>

          <p class="muted">
            This business isn’t just about delivering fuel. It’s about continuing to serve
            our neighbors with the same professionalism, reliability, and commitment that
            guided our years in public service—now in a new way, one delivery at a time.

              for family, or running a business.

              reliable experience that customers can trust and comfortably use again.
